# Amazon-WebScripping-Backend
### This project have two part. First part is the backend-part and the second one is the frontend-part.

This is the First part (BackEnd) of this project. Second part is https://github.com/Tasluf665/Amazon-Webscripping here. My recomandation is to, First download and install this part. Then download frontend part.

# Install nodeJs in your pc first. 

1. Download this project
2. open it on vs code
3. open vs code terminal ctrl+`
4. node index.js (Run this command in terminal). It will show Server is listing in port 3000. 

# If any error occurs

1. Delete the node_modules folder
2. run "npm install" in the terminal. [It will install the node_modules folder again]
3. then run "node index.js" in the terminal.

### Always open the backend part first and ensure that backend part always runs on port 3000. And frontend part runs on 3001. Unless you may see error.
