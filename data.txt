How are you supposed to measure your daily sleep logs and wear it during the day when the battery dies constantly? That’s what made me do research for a new smart watch. 2 years ago I got the titanium edition GTR. Loved that watch! But now I wanted more out of my smart watch, so again, I started to do as much research as possible for a new watch. I mean amazfit did me well the 1st time, figured let’s check out the new GTR pro. Basically does everything the latest Apple Watch does. Heart rate, blood oxygen, sleep and stress levels as well. Only been a day since getting it but so far so good! I love the look of the watch and I can barely tell it’s on my wrist. It’s a very very light watch. Even lighter then my previous GTR. You can wear it all day 24/7, battery will go on forever. Think I got around 2 weeks on my previous GTR, I’m assuming the new one will be just as good. I’ll test the rest of the features in the days coming and come back for updates. I’m almost certain I won’t be disappointed, you can’t go wrong with this watch. For the money it’s a no brainer.<br><br>So I’ve been wearing this watch for a little over a week now, and so far so LOVE IT!! I’ve tested my workouts on it, the gps measurements are spot on. I’ve also tested the blood oxygen feature, you can run tests whenever you want and you can also have it running all day. Just note this will drain your battery. It’s easy to switch back and forth on the ZEPP app. The same goes for stress levels and heart rate. I need to mention the watch face selections in the app. You have hundreds to choose from, I find myself switching daily, there’s just so many good ones.  I added another pic ( which btw has my original GTR titanium bands on it ).<br><br>  One last thing, I’ve been reading some things about people having trouble setting up the watch. It’s Soooooooo easy. Step one. Download the ZEPP app. Step 2 scan the bar code on the watch. Done.","reviewerImageList":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71177ig2A1L._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Cv-pNH1HL._SY88.jpg"]},{"reviewrName":"SactoBob","reviewrRating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"New Zepp OS needs work. Claims of over 100 watch faces is not accurate.","reviewDate":"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2021","reviewrReview":"After trying out their older GTR2 I was specifically recommended from the manufacturer to upgrade to the GTR3 to get the features I needed.  But this model has several issues. First the watch face I had on my GTR2 isn't available on the GTR3.  Okay fine, I'll find something else. But to that point their claim of over 100 watch faces is not true, and most of the ones available are horrible and cheesy. I've yet to find a lock-screen watch face with a second hand, which the manufacturer said was there(and why I upgraded), but they can't tell me which ones and instead I've got the go through all the faces available on their store to find it? The new Zepp OS in this watch has several issues. Despite me setting the watch-face \"on\" time to 30 seconds, this doesn't happen. It will frequently turn off in about 3 seconds, very rarely does it stay on for 30 seconds. Probably the worst issue with this watch is when you turn on a workout mode the watch face disappears and and clicking the main crown button brings up a workout menu, not the watch face! The older GTR2 allowed this, pushing workout mode to the background so I could see more metrics with a watch face.  Sometimes an incoming notification will 'confuse' the OS and I'll get the watch face back, but  will usually end up stuck in the workout mode. Basically an unusable watch during the entire workout. I consider the OS in the GTR3 a step backwards. I'll probably keep it and hope they fix these issues. But I've emailed and opened several tickets with them and have never heard back. Also using the phone's app to report an issue is a waste of time and only triggers an email asking you to go to their website to fill out another ticket. Disappointed overall, hoping they'll fix these issues. At least Christmas shopping on Amazon allows for a return period through January, so I may still end up sending it back. If they fix any of my issues I'll  update this review.","reviewerImageList":[]},{"reviewrName":"JumbaliahJumbaliah","reviewrRating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"GTR 3 PRO - Defective screen out of the box!","reviewDate":"Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2021","reviewrReview":"Bought a brand new GTR 3 Pro and upon opening it up and powering it on, the screen was defective right out of the box! They must not test these at all.  I didn't even get to use it because of the thick white line that runs down the entire length of the screen. Worst part is that these are sold out everywhere and Amazon currently has about a one month wait for replacements. Huge disappointment!","reviewerImageList":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61cSrOSGjTL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ne31DZtYL._SY88.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61vQxvXM8bL._SY88.jpg"]},{"reviewrName":"Amazon Customer","reviewrRating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"best value smart watch in the market","reviewDate":"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2021","reviewrReview":"I was in the market for a smartwatch for a while now, but I couldn’t find a model that fit my taste until this one. I love the classic big round screen display, and the leather band adds elegance and value to the watch.  I love the different watch face options, with convenient heart rate reading/steps/breathing rate. Some allow you to see the entire week’s weather forecast, humidity level, etc., and super easy to read incoming text messages and pick up calls (loud and clear) without holding a phone in your hand.  The one-button health measurements allow you to measure your heart rate, stress level, and breathing count at once. And a reminder for standing and walking every hour to keep up with healthy well-being.  One other cool feature: I started to wear this watch last Thursday. Almost a week into it, there’s still 20% battery life left. This is so cool, all the other smartwatches my friends own, they practically needed to charge them every day.","reviewerImageList":[]},{"reviewrName":"eebozz","reviewrRating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Nice looking watch, and does what I need for an iOS compatible watch","reviewDate":"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2021","reviewrReview":"This is my second Amazfit watch, I had a gtr lite before I purchased the gtr3 pro.  I also had a Samsung active 2 watch before I picked up the gtr3 pro.  I definitely prefer the gtr3 pro’s layout and interface over the active 2 watch, and overall I’m very happy with this watch, it has great features and looks awesome. Battery life has averaged three days between charges, I’m a little disappointed in the sleep tracking features, a couple times it showed I was awake for a long period of time when I was asleep.  This Review is an update from my original 3 star review to a 5 star now, because originally the Zepp app had serious issues where the app would change watch settings multiple times a day on its own. But, thankfully since the last app update those issues have been resolved.<br>Now I’m a happy camper!","reviewerImageList":[]}]}
